# RNA_editing_blood
RNA editing levels from RNA-seq of 459 human blood samples
The repository contains RNA editing levels for 2,079 confident sites from 459 human blood samples.
First, editing levels for the ~2M sites described in RADAR database were determined using REDITools starting from RNA-seq data.
Sites located in hard-to-map regions were removed and only sites with detectable editing level in at least 100 subject were 
included in the final dataset.
